Compiling into HTML
======================================

.. _pystart:

Python
--------------------------------------
To compile the Sphinx \*.rst files into an HTML web page you need to create a sphinx environment.

If you are using anaconda/miniconda (recommended) navigate to this repository and enter the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   conda env create --name sphinx -f sphx_env.yaml

This creates a new environment called “sphinx” which contains the necessary packages to compile the webpage.

Compiling \*.rst files into HTML
--------------------------------------

Once you have your environment created in conda, you can navigate to the *docsrc* folder, activate the sphinx environment and use the following command to create the index.html page:

.. code-block:: console

   make html
   
This will incorporate any changes you make in the \*.rst files or in the conf.py file into the \*.html files located in docs/html.

.. _linkgit:

Creating the webpage link in GitHub
--------------------------------------

Once you've created the html files necessary with "make html" and pushed those changes to GitHub, you can create a link within the repository page so that the website is easily accessible from the repository and also uses the index.html file to auto-populate that page.

Instructions

1. Go to the repository settings
* under Pages go to Branch
* click None dropdown and select main/
* click root dropdown and select docs/
* click Save

2. Use the website that's generated to then add it to your repository's "About" panel.
* go to main repository page on GitHub
* click the settings/gear icon next to "About"
* copy your webpage url generated from Step 1 into the website field

Now your repository will include a link to the webpage generated by GitHub from your \*.html files.

Go back to the `Home Page <home>`.
