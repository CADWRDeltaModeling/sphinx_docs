The *docsrc/source* folder is where all of the input \*.rst files go. For demonstration purposes there is: 

- *index.rst* the primary/most necessary file
- *conf.py* the configurations file which specifies how the project will be built
- *dwr_logo_small.png* which is used in the documentation to create the project
